// ❌ Does Java have destructors?
// No, Java does not have destructors like C++.

// ✅ Why not?
// // In Java, memory management is automatic. The Garbage Collector 
// //takes care of deleting objects that are no longer in use. Because of this, Java doesn’t need destructors like C++.


public class Destructor {// DELETE OBJECT FORM MAMMORY
    public static void main(){
        
    }
}
