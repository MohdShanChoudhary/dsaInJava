ðŸŒŠ What is a Flowchart?
A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the flow of a program step-by-step. It's like a map that helps you plan your code before you start writing it. Each step is shown as a shape, and arrows show how the logic moves from one step to the next.



ðŸ§  Why Use Flowcharts?
âœ… Easy to understand logic

âœ… Helps in debugging

âœ… Useful for explaining your program to others

âœ… Makes complex logic simple and visual
